Difference between dirty and strategised data preparation.
- Dirty cleaning is fast, and downsides are minimal as task is not ment for reproduceablility, but it all may just turn messy if we undervalue complexity of a task (as shown).
- Strategised take more time initially, but if task happens to be more complex than supposed, time investment get its returns and also its easier to manage, modify, read and overall a better pick.

It's a great meta-skill to distinguish when to use former and when to use later without falling into their downsides. 

(Goal is to get from text:
- only dialogs, 
- text without dialogs,
- list of all lines, also dialogs with extensions of supporting words as ment by author (more tricky than supposed).)

The rest is to come, this is side-side-project in progres.
